NoteBar.Compress

BUGS
Lit up LN detected as red shortnote
Chart.CalcB64thOrderNumber: A 32th note can fit in a 4th note, but the game would call it a 4th note. Higher note timings will jump to slots they can't be in.

FEATURES
LN coords for other cols
Offset to middle of note image for better accuracy. Especially for the middle note. Take FPS into account.
Support ReleaseNotes
Support Mines
Support VibroNotes
Support multiple BPM
Export to scc
Async
Shorter scc note blocks

NEW
Check if OutFox sends scores to server

Scale coords to resolution

Change code and example videos to 60fps full hd

LN Lit fix: when LNOngoing, loosen the maxColor boundries. Extra check LN Center lighter than Left and Right

Song database
	SQLite in Mega
	IsConverted
	HasReleaseNotes
	Song table one to many chart table
	View for chart to display song info

Mine check before note check so it's not detected as red shortnote

Check if OutFox even supports special notes

Add metadata to textbox on BPM input. Append chart metadata and notes on each dropped video

Check if OutFox already optimizes scc notes on saving

Optimize scc notes bar sizes by putting the row and bar data in classes and check for certain empty rows afterwards (post processing)
